# structure

this is a multi place game

we use mantle to manage multiple places

we use rojo for those individual places

to share all of the same scripts between places, we take all of the `.project.json` files and have them point to the same folder

you have to go into the individual place directories in order to appropriately `rojo serve`

if you exclusively want to sync the global and development files, then you can do it at the project directory

there will be some testing/development/tool libraries in the `development` folder, so `deployment.project.json` will be used to build the places for publishing

have fun navigating! i suggest navigating the codebase by using the project search function in your IDE

# the game itself

1. celeste movement
2. gunz the duel movement
3. ssbm mechanics

thats basically it

# license

we use creative commons | sharealike + attribution becuase

1. i dont like gatekeeping code :(
2. i want to credit the other people who worked on this project

all the scripts here, go fucking crazy, you dont need to credit me for that

but for all of the artistic assets, make sure to credit the respective artists. if you dont know who they are you can contact me :) (its usually just @pnmpki) most of the time
