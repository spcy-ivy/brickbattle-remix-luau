	i like zig's error handling better than `pcall`

	why not	`pcall`?
	1. theres no indicator that something can error
	2. thats like my only problem with it lmao

	why not rust's `result`?
	1. thats cool too :^), its just that i think zig's error handling is simpler and my gut likes it
	2. thats it i really like results too

	why zig's error handling?
	1. you know IF theres an error
	2. types make it explicit HOW the program can error
	3. heheheheh cool error convenience functions

	largely going to be inspied by this:
